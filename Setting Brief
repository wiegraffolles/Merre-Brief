You are peasants from the village of Firerock in the Duchy of Brightriver, so named for the abundance of Galena ore in its many rocky mountain river valleys. Your village is a poor one, but in times of peace and favourable weather you manage to subsist on a combination of pastoralism in the alpine valleys nearby, and marginal agriculture in the roughly terraced fields around town. In preparation for feasts or in times of scarcity you hunt elk in the many mountain forests above Firerock, but for the most part you avoid them for fear of the creatures that live within their dark expanses.

The village of Firerock is named after the large volcanic rock that sits seemingly out of place in the centre of town, being quite unlike the rocks found throughout the valley. There is a story passed down through the generations that the rock was hurled into the valley in an ancient battle of giants, but no one knows if this is truth or fiction. Your huts are made of mountain rock and crude morter, and topped with thatching that you acquired from lowlanders in exchange for sheep's wool that you managed to secret away from the Duke's tax collectors. 

Three years ago the men of the village were called to battle by your Duke, Aedelmaer II, to do battle against his ancient foes - the Riverland Greyoaks. Leaving the mountain valley of Firerock seemed to you a great adventure at the time, and you were dazzled by the assembly of men of various towns gathered at the Duke's stronghold in preparation for war. There you were given basic training in the ways of war, and then went on to fight in a hot summer campaign against the Riverlanders. The open river valley lowlands were uncomfortable expanses to ones born in the deep mountain valleys of Brightriver, but you managed to adapt to the new terrain in time, and fought admirably against the Greyoak forces. As a reward Aedelmaer granted you a tapestry depicting the great Firerock of your village and the opportunity to pick a weapon each from his armoury. Since those days of glory you have returned to the seasonal rhythms of village life, but a grim occurrence has jolted you once again out of complacency...
